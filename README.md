An application for managing content for a roleplaying game.

## What is a Roleplaying Game?

A game where players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. The player characters (PC) interact with the game world and its inhabitants through the referee, known as the Game Master, who regulates the PCs and controls the world.

## Why is this needed?

Because a simple game can become infinitely more complex at the whims of players or a particularly erudite Game Master. Life is complex and people tend to play what they know. They add additional, usually unnecessary complexity, to their hobby.

Inventory management alone can be a chore, as well as the extensive cast of characters and monsters that make up the typical tabletop gaming session.
